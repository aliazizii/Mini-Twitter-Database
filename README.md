# Mini-Twitter-Database
This was done as a database design course project at Amirkabir university of technology. This is a relational database management system that is built using MySQL and works with CLI in python.

This project contains the following files:

   * tables.sql: A DDL script to generate relational tables for our mini-twitter schema including relevant constraints.
   
   * procedures.sql: Several procedures to perform complex queries.
   
   * triggers.sql: Some triggers that are sensitive to a particular event and perform specific tasks as they occur.
   
   * Relational_schema.png: Relational Schema to better visualize relations among the tables.
   
   * database.py: A user interface through which we can communicate with the database through CLI and it uses all the features implemented for the Twitter system designed.
